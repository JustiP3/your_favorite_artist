# YourFavoriteArtist

This gem uses the last.fm API to tell you information about your favorite artist. Type in your favorite artist, then the gem will retrieve your artist's information from last.fm and prompt you with options such as "Related artists", "Top albums", and "Top songs". 

You also have the option to see more details:
For "Related artists" you can choose an artist and see their top songs.
For "Top albums" you can select an album and see the tracklist.
